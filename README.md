🧠 Working Principle

The RTC (DS1307) continuously provides real-time data (hours, minutes, seconds, date).

The LM35 sensor measures the ambient temperature; its analog output is converted to digital using the ADC module of the microcontroller.

The LCD displays current time, date, and temperature with smooth scrolling transitions.

When the alarm time equals the real-time clock, the buzzer activates to alert the user.

Interrupts from RTC and keypad ensure precise timing and fast user response.

Explanation:

The LPC2148 microcontroller interfaces with the RTC module, LM35 sensor, and LCD.

The buzzer is controlled through a GPIO pin and is triggered when alarm time matches real-time.

ADC channels are used for reading temperature sensor output.

External interrupts handle real-time updates and keypad inputs efficiently.
